    <h2>About</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      I am a BSCS student with a strong passion for Web Development and a clear
      vision to build my career as a professional Web Developer. Currently, I am
      enhancing my technical expertise through hands-on learning in HTML, CSS,
      JavaScript, and modern frameworks, while also exploring best practices in
      front-end and back-end development. Alongside my studies, I have
      professional experience as a Video Editor, Graphic Designer, and Social
      Media Manager. I am skilled in tools such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe
      Photoshop, and Canva, where I have worked on creating engaging digital
      content, managing social media platforms, and designing creative visuals
      that help brands grow. In addition, I am a Podcast Host on YouTube, where
      I create and share content that blends creativity with meaningful
      discussions. This experience has sharpened my communication, content
      creation, and audience engagement skills. With a unique combination of
      technical learning and creative expertise, I bring a diverse perspective
      to problem-solving and innovation. My goal is to become a skilled Web
      Developer while continuing to grow in the fields of digital media and
      technology. ðŸ’¡ I am actively seeking opportunities to work with
      professionals, collaborate on projects, and explore job roles where I can
      apply my skills, learn, and contribute to impactful work.
